# TheCProgrammingLanguageExcercises

These are my solutions for The C Programming Language 2nd Edition.
Each directory is a section of the book and each file is named after the excercise number.
So, for example, the excercise 1-8 would be located on directory named "1" and file name should be "8".
Hope they are helpful for you.
